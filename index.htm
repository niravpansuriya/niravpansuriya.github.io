  </b> In past years, computer architecture has become increasingly parallel, with the use of GPUs
  and multi-core CPUs. We have massive parallelism available in modern GPU like NVIDIA
  GForce GTX 280. So, the focus of researchers moved on parallelism rather than continuous
  improvements of the single unit speed of computation. In physics, mathematics and en-
  gineering, we frequently encountered many linear systems. In many scientic simulations,
  we have to solve large-scale linear equations. But in general, large-scale linear equations
  take high time and resources like memory. We always want an algorithm that can solve
  large-scale linear equations in less time and resources. As during the last 2 decades, we have
  witnessed too many improvements in computer hardware, now we can see the expansion
  of parallelization in many domains. Many researchers have come up with parallel meth-
  ods to solve linear systems. Most of these methods only work with sparse matrix linear
  systems. To overcome this problem, two researchers, Afshin Ahmadi and Amin Khademi
  - in a recent paper named "A Parallel Jacobi-Embedded Gauss-Seidel Method", came up
  with a new method, that can work in parallel architecture and also can work with any type
  of matrix linear system. I aim to implement this method in multicore architecture and
  compare its performance with some other parallel methods used for solving linear equations
  systems. My other aim is to extend their work by trying to modify the proposed method
  to make it faster. I would like to implement the proposed method in distributed memory
  architecture by making appropriate changes in this method.
